Velociratchet - Meteor Mobile App Prototyping With Page Transitions
=============

Velociratchet is a Meteor mobile app prototyping tool built on [Ratchet](http://goratchet.com/), [VelocityJS](http://julian.com/research/velocity/), [Momentum](https://github.com/percolatestudio/meteor-momentum), and [Iron Router](http://eventedmind.github.io/iron-router/).

It is currently a demo; read the code and use what you like.

In the near future we're planning to package it for Meteor.

## Fade page transitions

All page transitions are `vratchet-fade` by default, which uses the `fade` animation from Momentum.

## Left-to-right page transitions

Use the Ratchet CSS classes .navigate-left and .icon-left-nav for left-to-right page transitions.

This will create transitions `vratchet-left-to-right`, which use the `left-to-right` animation from Momentum.

## Right-to-left page transitions

Use the Ratchet CSS classes .navigate-right and .icon-right-nav for right-to-left page transitions.

This will create transitions `vratchet-right-to-left`, which use the `right-to-left` animation from Momentum.
